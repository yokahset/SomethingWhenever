# What is this website?

I've been making creative content for a long time.
For almost as long as I've made it, that content has lacked a home.
Whenever I've gone to share the works I feel comfortable sharing, it's been linking people to files on Google Drive, and other silly things. 
No more. 

Something Whenever is a place for *something* **whenever**. 
That's all. 

It could be blog style content, photos, videos, songs I've written, lyrics I liked, anything. 
This is a place where I can dump all the cool things I'm working on, projects I care about, and give it all a home. 

## When is 'good enough?' 

I've been working on this website for a long time. 
In a lot of ways I've been working on it for years.
I've played with the concept, what I wanted it to be, and let the idea steep. 
When I started actively trying to find a framework that allows me to create and host this website this year, lots more challenges started.
The problem with DIY anything is that you're doing all of it *yourself.* 

I've run into a lot of setbacks, conceptual limitations, and differences between my vision and how I am able to implement it in reality. 
The truth is, this website **isn't what I want it to be.** 
I had a different layout in mind, a better categorization system.
I had cleaner pages I wanted to sort the topics out, better access to things. 
These ideas became more and more of a logistical nightmare. 
It took me quickly out from the development phase back into the research phase MANY times over. 

All the while, more and more ideas come to me that I want to share.
Most posts are formulating in my mind, more content, more everything.
I thought I would be done with this site a few weeks ago. 
Had the layout worked how I thought it did, I would have been. 
But here we are. 

## Giving up in a good way. 

I'm done. 
What we have now, is *what well have, for now.*
I can always improve later.
I can always make changes.
I can re-design the entire site as I see fit at any time. 
I do not need to have my ideal kitchen to be happy in my home. 

This is the website. Welcome! 

I'm still proud of it, and proud of what we're going to build it into. 
Not being there yet doesn't mean we should diminish what we have now. 
This is still an excellent little site, and I'm excited to fill it with love and content in the coming days, weeks, months, and years. 
I hope you'll get some enjoyment out of what's here! 

## So what *is* here? 

Well right now, not much! But now that the framework is up and running,[^1] more will be up here soon.
There's a lot of great music, film, and TV I've been watching and I'm sure I'll have something on that to say. 
There's also a bunch of stuff from the back catalog I'll be posting, probably alongside some commentary as well with it.
All I know is you'll get *something* **whenever** and that's all I'll say. 

## How do we find out when you post something new? 

Great question. I'll have an RSS feed setup that you can subscribe to.
No worries if you don't understand what that means.
I'll exlplain what that is when I get it working, and show ya how to connect to it. 
The long and short of it is, **you can sign up for notifications through an app like Google News or another RSS reader and it will push website content straight to your feed.**
Pretty nifty! 

## So what now? 

Who knows? Me personally, I'm going to enjoy the fact that this website is very much working,[^2] that I am on-time for my scheduled bed-time,[^3] and that I'll be off for a nice relaxing day off tomorrow.[^4]
As for you, I hope you're being kind to yourself, remembering that you're doing great, and remembering to breathe. 


I can't wait to see what's next. 

**Footnotes**:
[^1]: The framework is very much *not* up and running as I write this. Art is a lie. 
[^2]: Again, this website is 100% *not even published* right now. Don't trust me.  
[^3]: I am very much NOT on time.
[^4]: I have work at 7am tomorrow.
