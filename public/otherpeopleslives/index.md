# Other People's Lives by Dan Campbell


## Introduction

*Other People's Lives* is an album Dan wrote during the Pandemic. 
While the world stopped touring, he was both looking for a creative focus and source of income to try and keep the lights on.
Dan started offering song-writing packages where he would interview you, and write / record a song for you. 
In hindsight, I desperately wish I did it. 
I thought about doing it at the time, and I couldn't afford it, but man. 
He'll probably never do this again, and that would've been so damn cool. 

Instead, you and I both get to live through the lens of the little moments Dan recreates across the album. 
Dan takes us through stories of loss, love, familial struggle, and weaves the narrative of these strangers with such intense visual threads. 
It's easy to get lost in the landscape he paints. 
I find myself sitting in moments I've never been in, breathing air I've never smelled, taking it all in.

This album has a collection of some of his best writing, in my opinion. 
It's a tough call, because Dan covers so many different styles across each of his projects with *The Wonder Years, Aaron West & The Roaring Twenties,* and now *Dan Campbell,* that it's not a fair comparison.
I'm a sucker for a good ballad, and Dan writes a down-tempo song just as well as a mosh inducing banger.

### *Conversations with the Flowers* 

{{< admonition type=info title="Lyrics (click to open)" open=false >}}
[Verse 1]

Weak coffee, pre-dawn. We're sneaking out like we robbed the place

Mayflower beach, July's gone. We're all alone dancing in the waves

I found you some sea glass.

You always loved sea glass

I see you, in the side room, chainsmoking darts in your favorite chair

You tell me about the moon, or Ursa Minor, the Little Bear

I peer through your telescope. I see the parts you want me to know

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And I'll remind the flowers every morning in the dawn

I'll make sure they don't forget they're wanted and they're loved

I'll carry what you taught me - I'll hold it close until I'm gone

I'll sleep in peace. I'll wake in light. I'll soldier on

&nbsp;


[Verse 2]

They should name you the Saint of Patience for all the shit that you put up with

Still awake at 3 a.m. since you couldn't sleep 'til the kids were in

And I sip slow on a Barry's Tea, the kind that you'd always make for me

In your dress shoes and a bathrobe, lost in a blue plume of Pall Mall smoke

You tell a story that doesn't end, so I laugh along with you as you go

'Cause your idea of heaven is us at 187

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And I'll remind the flowers every morning in the dawn

I'll make sure they don't forget they're wanted and they're loved

I'll carry what you taught me; hold it close until I'm gone


I'll sleep in peace

I'll wake in light

I'll soldier on

I'll sleep in peace

I'll wake in light

I'll soldier on

I'll sleep in peace

I'll wake in light

I'll soldier on

All right, you've caught me. 
I don't actually have any content here in this moment. 

I needed a test page to push some content and I started something I knew I couldn't finish in this moment. 

I guess you'll just have to listen to the album before I finish talking about it? Sounds pretty fucking cool of you. <3 

Have a kickass day.  
See you soon.

I can't believe *you*.

Have you ever wondered what a mermaid looks like?

```python 
def LookAtMermaid()
    if (mermaidsExist == true):
        GaspInHorror()
    else:
        return "Mermaids aren't real, BRO"

```
The key part of of a successful day is having access to the `SmokeThatWeed()` function. Make sure that's in a name-space you're comfortable with.
