While the world stopped touring, he was both looking for a creative focus and source of income to try and keep the lights on. Dan started offering song-writing packages where he would interview you, and write / record a song for you. In hindsight, I desperately wish I did it. I thought about doing it at the time, and I couldn’t afford it, but man. He’ll probably never do this again, and that would’ve been so damn cool. Instead, you and I both get to live through the lens of the little moments Dan recreates across the album. Dan takes us through stories of loss, love, familial struggle, and weaves the narrative of these strangers with such intense visual threads. It’s easy to get lost in the landscape he paints. I find myself sitting in moments I’ve never been in, breathing air I’ve never smelled, taking it all in. This album has a collection of some of his best writing, in my opinion. It’s a tough call, because Dan covers so many different styles across each of his projects with The Wonder Years, Aaron West \u0026 The Roaring Twenties, and now Dan Campbell, that it’s not a fair comparison. I’m a sucker for a good ballad, and Dan writes a down-tempo song just as well as a mosh inducing banger.

We’re sneaking out like we robbed the place Mayflower beach, July’s gone. We’re all alone dancing in the waves I found you some sea glass. You always loved sea glass I see you, in the side room, chainsmoking darts in your favorite chair You tell me about the moon, or Ursa Minor, the Little Bear I peer through your telescope. I see the parts you want me to know [Chorus] And I’ll remind the flowers every morning in the dawn I’ll make sure they don’t forget they’re wanted and they’re loved I’ll carry what you taught me - I’ll hold it close until I’m gone I’ll sleep in peace. I’ll wake in light. I’ll soldier on [Verse 2] They should name you the Saint of Patience for all the shit that you put up with Still awake at 3 a.m. since you couldn’t sleep ’til the kids were in And I sip slow on a Barry’s Tea, the kind that you’d always make for me In your dress shoes and a bathrobe, lost in a blue plume of Pall Mall smoke You tell a story that doesn’t end, so I laugh along with you as you go ‘Cause your idea of heaven is us at 187 [Chorus] And I’ll remind the flowers every morning in the dawn I’ll make sure they don’t forget they’re wanted and they’re loved I’ll carry what you taught me; hold it close until I’m gone I’ll sleep in peace I’ll wake in light I’ll soldier on I’ll sleep in peace I’ll wake in light I’ll soldier on I’ll sleep in peace I’ll wake in light I’ll soldier on All right, you’ve caught me. I don’t actually have any content here in this moment. I needed a test page to push some content and I started something I knew I couldn’t finish in this moment. I guess you’ll just have to listen to the album before I finish talking about it? Sounds pretty fucking cool of you. \u003c3 Have a kickass day. See you soon. DO NOT OPEN THIS\rWow, you didn’t. I can’t believe you. Have you ever wondered what a mermaid looks like? def LookAtMermaid() if (mermaidsExist == true): GaspInHorror() else: return \"Mermaids aren't real, BRO\" The key part of of a successful day is having access to the SmokeThatWeed() function.

For almost as long as I’ve made it, that content has lacked a home. Whenever I’ve gone to share the works I feel comfortable sharing, it’s been linking people to files on Google Drive, and other silly things. No more. Something Whenever is a place for something whenever. That’s all. It could be blog style content, photos, videos, songs I’ve written, lyrics I liked, anything. This is a place where I can dump all the cool things I’m working on, projects I care about, and give it all a home.

In a lot of ways I’ve been working on it for years. I’ve played with the concept, what I wanted it to be, and let the idea steep. When I started actively trying to find a framework that allows me to create and host this website this year, lots more challenges started. The problem with DIY anything is that you’re doing all of it yourself. I’ve run into a lot of setbacks, conceptual limitations, and differences between my vision and how I am able to implement it in reality. The truth is, this website isn’t what I want it to be. I had a different layout in mind, a better categorization system. I had cleaner pages I wanted to sort the topics out, better access to things. These ideas became more and more of a logistical nightmare. It took me quickly out from the development phase back into the research phase MANY times over. All the while, more and more ideas come to me that I want to share. Most posts are formulating in my mind, more content, more everything. I thought I would be done with this site a few weeks ago. Had the layout worked how I thought it did, I would have been. But here we are.

What we have now, is what well have, for now. I can always improve later. I can always make changes. I can re-design the entire site as I see fit at any time.

Not being there yet doesn’t mean we should diminish what we have now.

The long and short of it is, you can sign up for notifications through an app like Google News or another RSS reader and it will push website content straight to your feed. Pretty nifty!
